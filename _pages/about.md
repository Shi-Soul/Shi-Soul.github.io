I'm a undergraduate student majoring Artificial Intelligence at [Shanghai Jiao Tong university](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) enrolled in 2021. Now I'm a Research Intern at [Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom](http://www.chinatelecom.com.cn/), co-worked with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/). I'm also a member of [APEX Lab](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/).

My research interests include **Reinforcement Learning** and **Robotics**, recently working on **Humanoid Locomotion**.
