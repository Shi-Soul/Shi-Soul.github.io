I'm a undergraduate student majoring Artificial Intelligence at [Shanghai Jiao Tong university](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) enrolled in 2021. Now I'm a member of [APEX Lab](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/).

My research interests include **Reinforcement Learning** and **Robotics**.

This is my personal homepage under active development. Most information of the default template haven't been cleaned up and please ignore them.
